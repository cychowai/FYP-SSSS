> Final Year Project --- Shamir's secret sharing scheme (CD1)

## Project Description:
    
    Secret sharing refers to method for distributing a secret amongst a group of participants, each of whom is allocated a share of the secret. The secret can be reconstructed only when a sufficient number of shares are combined together; individual shares are of no use on their own.

    The objective of this FYP is to have an online implementation of Shamir's secret sharing scheme similar to the one in the URL:
